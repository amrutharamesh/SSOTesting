        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Waits for a certain amount of time for an action to complete
        Designed to wait for a certain length of time,
        either linearly in 1 second steps, or exponentially, up to a maximum.
        Returns the output from the function once it completes successfully,
        along with the time taken to complete the command.
        
        .. note::
           If using the expo keyword, the returned elapsed time will be inaccurate
           as wait_for does not know the exact time that the function returned
           correctly, only that it returned correctly at last check.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
          from wait_for import wait_for
        
          class Incrementor():
              value = 0
        
              def i_sleep_a_lot(self):
                  time.sleep(.1)
                  self.value += 1
                  return self.value
        
        
          incman = Incrementor()
          ec, tc = wait_for(incman.i_sleep_a_lot,
                            fail_condition=0,
                            delay=.05)
          print("Function output {} in time {} ".format(ec, tc))
